/**
 * The {@link PhotoOverlay} element allows you to geographically locate a photograph on the Earth and to specify viewing parameters for this PhotoOverlay. The PhotoOverlay can be a simple 2D rectangle, a partial or full cylinder, or a sphere (for spherical panoramas). The overlay is placed at the specified location and oriented toward the viewpoint.
 * 
 * Because {@link PhotoOverlay} is derived from {@link Feature}, it can contain one of the two elements derived from {@link AbstractView} either {@link Camera} or {@link LookAt}. The {@link Camera} (or {@link LookAt}) specifies a viewpoint and a viewing direction (also referred to as a view vector). The PhotoOverlay is positioned in relation to the viewpoint. Specifically, the plane of a 2D rectangular image is orthogonal (at right angles to) the view vector. The normal of this plane�that is, its front, which is the part with the photo�is oriented toward the viewpoint.
 * 
 * The URL for the PhotoOverlay image is specified in the {@link Icon} tag, which is inherited from {@link Overlay}. The {@link Icon} tag must contain an href element that specifies the image file to use for the PhotoOverlay. In the case of a very large image, the href is a special URL that indexes into a pyramid of images of varying resolutions (see {@link ImagePyramid}).
